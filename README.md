# Simple Bar Graph

This was a simple exercise in using Expressjs and D3 to create a simple visualision. I followed the [tutorial by Eze Sunday here](https://blog.logrocket.com/data-visualization-d3-js-node-js/). There are some modifications I had to do due to changes in versions and some minor modificaitons.

## Install and run

    git clone git@github.com:harsha5500/simple-vis.git
    cd simple-vis
    nvm install
    node server.js
